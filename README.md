Traffic Accident Risk Prediction ðŸš¦
This project predicts the risk of traffic accidents (High Risk or Low Risk) based on geographical coordinates and weather conditions using a machine learning model (Random Forest).

Features:-
Predicts traffic accident risk using latitude, longitude, and weather conditions.
Utilizes a trained Random Forest model for accurate predictions.
Web interface built with Django.
Model trained on historical traffic and weather data.
Project Structure:-
main/: Django app containing views and templates.
prediction_model/: Folder containing the trained model (accident_model.pkl).
templates/: HTML files for the frontend.
static/: CSS for styling the web pages.
dataset/: Folder with road and weather datasets used for training.
